        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> I am Assistant Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.
            My research employs data analytics and mathematical modelling to understand the
            transmission and control of infectious pathogens.
            I have a particular interest in arboviruses and respiratory pathogens,
            as well as spatio-temporal epidemiology. Key research projects for my laboratory now include
            the use of high-resolution, high-dimensional databases to understand:<br><br>
            (1) the impact of novel vector control tools on arboviral transmission<br><br>
            (2) the forecastability of disease burden over large spatial scales and<br><br>
            (3) long-term post-acute consequences and complications of arboviral and respiratory infection<br><br>
            </p>


          <h2>Opportunities</h2>
          <p> I am actively are recruiting PhD students (fully funded for 4 years, with monthly stipend, tuition fees and conference funding),
            and Research Associates/Assistants (Masters/Bachelors level). Undergraduate students who are looking for research opportunities are also welcome to approach me.
            <br><br>
            Candidates should at least have a degree in a quantitative field,
            such as data science, computational biology, mathematics, computer science, (bio)statistics, or related field.
            Research experience and/or educational background in public health and medicine is a plus but not essential.
            Candidate with bachelorâ€™s degree in the above disciplines with strong record of research will be considered.
            The candidate should have strong quantitative skills, or at least demonstrate interest in developing skills in biostatistics and infectious disease modelling.
            <br><br>
            Please do not hesitant to contact me!
            </p>
